QUESTION 1:
Develop an application allowing users to manage shopping cart items. The application should
display at least 10 products with product names and amounts. The application should enable
the user to add products to the shopping cart, increase or decrease the number of items in the
cart, delete items and get the total amount of the products. The application should also have a
coupon discount feature whereby you can input coupon codes to get a discount
(WEB3BRIDGECOHORTx) to get a 10% discount upon checkout. The cart should persist upon
page refresh.
Features:
● Inputs must be validated using Regular Expressions
● Display all products in the shopping cart section with options to increase or decrease
quantity or remove items from the cart.
● Persist the data upon page refresh.
